{/* Hi */}
Hi, welcome to my corner of the internet!

{/* Prev Work */}
I am currently working as an Applied AI Engineer at a small scale US-based startup. Before this, I worked with fullstack and infra at Samsung R&D for ~2 years.

{/* What I am doing right now */}
These days, I am trying to keep up with the research and applied side of AI. My goal right now is to get get really good at understanding the [fundamental](https://gwern.net/doc/science/1986-hamming) and [seminal](https://arc.net/folder/D0472A20-9C20-4D3F-B145-D2865C0A9FEE) research in the field and dive deeper into the [rabbit holes](https://x.com/thepushkarp/status/1876322871393620011) of parts that interest me.

{/* What is this site about */}
This site is is a place to keep a track of my thoughts, [writings](/blog), learnings, [projects](/projects) and [everything else](/misc) that I feel I should document and share. Over time, I hope to build a collecting of cool stuff that I can [look back to](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc?si=SKb-Z4M-Jl1N1u52&t=297) and be proud of.

{/* How can you contact me */}
If you want to chat, build something interesting together, or hire me, you can [hit me a dm on twitter](https://twitter.com/thepushkarp) or mail me at [the-email-address-mentioned-at-the-footer-of-this-site]. I am open to project collaborations, part-time gigs, and full-time opportunities and anything else that's fun and exciting to work on.

{/* What I do in my free time */}
Besides work, you can find me [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/98783562-pushkar), talking about [etymology](/etymology), running, working out, and occasionally posting thoughts and memes.

Feel free to look around!
