## Don’t Worry

<PoetryAuthor>
by Anna Kamienska (Translated by Grażyna Drabik and David Curzon)
</PoetryAuthor>

<Poetry>
> Don’t worry there’ll still be a lot of suffering
> For now you have the right to cling to the sleeve
> of someone’s blunt friendship
> To be happy is a duty which you neglect
> A careless user of time
> you send days like geese to the meadow
> Don’t worry you’ll die many times
> until you learn at the very end to love life
</Poetry>


## Waiting

<PoetryAuthor>
by Leza Lowitz
</PoetryAuthor>

<Poetry>
> You keep waiting for something to happen,
> the thing that lifts you out of yourself,
>
> catapults you into doing all the things you've put off
> the great things you're meant to do in your life,
>
> but somehow never quite get to.
> You keep waiting for the planets to shift
>
> the new moon to bring news,
> the universe to align, something to give.
>
> Meanwhile, the pile of papers, the laundry, the dishes the job –
> it all stacks up while you keep hoping
>
> for some miracle to blast down upon you,
> scattering the piles to the winds.
>
> Sometimes you lie in bed, terrified of your life.
> Sometimes you laugh at the privilege of waking.
>
> But all the while, life goes on in its messy way.
> And then you turn forty. Or fifty. Or sixty...
>
> and some part of you realizes you are not alone
> and you find signs of this in the animal kingdom
>
> when a snake sheds its skin its eyes glaze over,
> it slinks under a rock, not wanting to be touched,
>
> and when caterpillar turns to butterfly
> if the pupa is brushed, it will die –
>
> and when the bird taps its beak hungrily against the egg
> it's because the thing is too small, too small,
>
> and it needs to break out.
> And midlife walks you into that wisdom
>
> that this is what transformation looks like –
> the mess of it, the tapping at the walls of your life,
>
> the yearning and writhing and pushing,
> until one day, one day
>
> you emerge from the wreck
> embracing both the immense dawn
>
> and the dusk of the body,
> glistening, beautiful
>
> just as you are.
