_**sidenote**: many of these were posted as tweets on my old deleted account many moons ago. thanks to gpt and claude, i was able to retrieve them from that massive tweet archive (over 270k tokens after cleaning up the json). i also used these ai tools for some initial formatting and cleaning up, hence the language might sound a little ai-esque right now. i'll be manually rewording them all later._

## 1. Noida and Okhla

NOIDA is an abbreviation of 'New Okhla Industrial Development Authority.' Funnily, OKHLA stands for 'Old Canal Housing and Land Authority,' where the "C" was replaced with "K" probably to make it sound better. The upcoming "New Noida" hence expands to 'New New Old Canal Housing and Land Authority Industrial Development Authority,'

## 2. Anaphora

The term "anaphora" refers to a rhetorical device involving the repetition of a word or phrase at the beginning of successive clauses or sentences. Its etymology traces back to Greek, where "ana-" means "back" or "again," and "pherein" means "to bear" or "to carry." Thus, anaphora literally translates to "carrying back," reflecting its function of repeating words to create emphasis or rhythm in speech or writing.

---

## 3. Serendipity

The word "serendipity" refers to the occurrence of events by chance in a happy or beneficial way. It was coined by Horace Walpole in 1754, inspired by a Persian fairy tale, "The Three Princes of Serendip." Serendip is an old name for Sri Lanka. In the tale, the princes were always making discoveries by accidents and sagacity, of things they were not in quest of, which perfectly encapsulates the meaning of the word today.

## 4. Argentum and its Sanskrit Roots

The Latin term 'argentum' is where the chemical symbol 'Ag' for silver originates. The word 'argentum' itself is derived from Proto-Indo-European *h₂erǵ-, which means 'shiny' or 'white'. The Sanskrit 'रजत' (rajata) similarly denotes silver and is rooted in the ancient Indo-European language family, sharing a similar etymological lineage with Latin.

The Hindi word 'चांदी' (chandi) is also mentioned, which refers to silver. The term 'चांदी' is derived from the Prakrit word 'चन्दि' (chandi), which in turn came from the Sanskrit 'चन्द्र' (chandra), meaning 'moon', reflecting the shiny, moon-like appearance of silver.

---

## 5. Bangaladumpa

The term 'bangaladumpa' is used in Telugu to refer to a potato. This word is fascinating because 'bangala' refers to Bengal, and 'dumpa' in Telugu means 'tuber'. Bangaladumpa reflects historical trade or cultural exchanges between regions, as the name suggests it is a tuber from Bengal.

---

## 6. Falsafa and Philosophia

The word "falsafa" is an Urdu term that is borrowed from the Greek word "philosophia," meaning philosophy. The borrowing process involves minor modifications to fit the phonetic and grammatical context of the Urdu language. This type of word borrowing, where the original word is adopted with slight changes, is common in many languages and is known as a loanword.

---

## 7. French -ette Words

The suffix "-ette" of French origin is often added to words to denote a smaller version of something. Some examples include:
- Cigar + ette -> cigarette (a small cigar)
- Cask + ette -> caskette (casket, a small container)
- Bra + (l) + ette -> bralette (a smaller, lighter version of a bra)

The term "brunette" is derived from the French word "brun," which means "brown." The suffix "-ette," often used to form feminine nouns, indicates a smaller or lesser version of something. Therefore, "brunette" refers to a small brown person, typically used in the context of describing females.

The word "omelette" has its origins in the Latin word "lamella," meaning "a thin plate," which also gives rise to the word "laminate." This evolved into "le lemelle" in French, then to "alemelle," "alemette," and finally "omelette."

The word "etiquette" traces its origin to the French court of Louis XIV at Versailles, where "étiquettes" (literally "little cards") were used to remind courtiers to keep off the grass and follow other rules. The term came to mean "the rules of polite and correct behavior." The Old French word "estequier" means "to stick/attach," which evolved into "estiquette" in Middle French, referring to a small note or ticket. This further influenced the modern French term "étiquettes," which signifies a label or ticket.

---

## 8. Prapanch

Prapanch actually comes from Sanskrit and is a word borrowed into many languages. It literally means "five elements" and is referred to mean the world/sansaar. Hinduism considers these five as the basis of all cosmic creation. The word has evolved over time and in some regions/languages, it has come to mean "dhokha" or "scam," which is an interesting semantic shift. The use of 'prapanch' by Tulsidas in his works to mean earthly/worldly pleasures adds to its layered meaning across different contexts.

## 9. Pronouncing French Words like Bhojpuri

Repertoire (रेपटवा), boudoir (बूद्वा), memoire (मेमवा), and reservoire (रेसरवा) are French words borrowed into English that end with -oire or -oir. These words are very easy to pronounce like a true Frenchperson if you start to think of them like Bhojpuri words such as बबुआ, रमुआ, बलमवा.

---

## 10. Mosquito and Makkhi

The word "mosquito" comes from Spanish. It stems from the root "mosca," which means a "fly" (makkhi). Adding an "-ito" to a Spanish word forms a diminutive (smaller version of something), so a mosquito is literally a small fly. The "-ito" is used for males, and the female version is "-ita." This etymology highlights how the word evolved to indicate a small fly, emphasizing its diminutive nature in the Spanish language.

The word "mosca" in Spanish, which means a "fly," is related to the Sanskrit word "maksa-," which gives the Sanskrit word for a fly, "makshika" (मक्खिका), leading to the Hindi "makkhi." This connection showcases the linguistic evolution and the shared roots between Spanish and Sanskrit, illustrating the fascinating interplay of languages across cultures and time.

## 11. Metric System Prefixes

The prefixes "mili," "centi," and "deci" originate from Latin. These prefixes are commonly used in the metric system to denote fractional units of measurement, such as millimeter (one-thousandth of a meter), centimeter (one-hundredth of a meter), and decimeter (one-tenth of a meter).

The prefixes "deca," "hecto," and "kilo" come from Greek. They are used in the metric system to indicate multiples of units, such as decameter (ten meters), hectometer (one hundred meters), and kilometer (one thousand meters).

In counting currencies, "kilo," representing a thousand (as in 100k), is derived from Greek, while other terms such as million, billion, and trillion come from Latin. "Million" comes from the Italian "milione," which further traces back to "mille" in Latin, meaning "thousand." The terms "billion" and "trillion" follow similar etymological patterns, originating from the Latin words "bi-" (two) and "tri-" (three), combined with "million."

---

## 12. Shampoo and Champee

The English word "shampoo" is borrowed from the Hindi word "champee" (चंपी), which means to press or massage. This borrowing reflects the cultural and commercial exchange between Britain and India during the colonial period, where such practices were introduced to English speakers.

---

## 13. Varanasi, Benaras, and Banaras

Varanasi, also known as Benaras or Banaras, is a city in India with a rich historical and cultural heritage. The name Varanasi is derived from the names of two rivers, Varuna and Assi. These rivers are significant in the city's geography and cultural context. During the Mughal and British periods, the variations Benaras and Banaras became popular. Despite other stories regarding the origin of these names, the explanation involving the rivers is often considered the simplest and is supported by Occam's Razor, suggesting that the simplest explanation is usually the correct one.

---

## 14. Ephemeral

'Ephemeral' comes from the Greek word 'ephēmeros', which can be broken into 'epi' + 'hemera'. 'Epi' means on/upon, and 'hemera' means a day. In Greek mythology, Hemera was personified as the daughter of Erebus (darkness) and Nyx (night), and the sister of Aether (bright upper sky). Therefore, 'ephemera' in the literal sense is something that lasts for a day. The meaning has developed over time to refer to things that last for a very short time, such as plants/insects, fevers, and in the modern sense, anything fleeting, momentary, passing, or transitory.

---

## 15. Calendar Months

The names of these months have Latin roots that reflect their original positions in the Roman calendar, which had only 10 months beginning in March. 'September' has 'sept' in it, which is Latin for 7, even though it is the 9th month now. 'October' comes from 'octo', meaning 8 (as in octopus). 'November' is derived from 'novem', meaning 9, and 'December' from 'dec', meaning 10 (as in decametre). January and February were added later and were not part of the original Roman calendar.

---

## 16. Vulgar

The word 'vulgar' originates from the Latin word 'vulgaris,' which means 'common people.' The notion of being 'vulgar' in historical contexts referred to someone being a commoner. Over time, due to snobbery against common people, the term began to be associated with something rude or offensive. The term is also related to 'Vulgar Latin,' a branch of Latin that was considered the spoken form used by everyday people, as opposed to the classical Latin used in formal writings and speeches.

---

## 17. Romance Languages

Romance languages are called so because they originated from Rome. The term does not relate to romantic or affectionate communication but pertains to their roots in the Roman Empire and Latin language.

---

## 18. Chiniya and Badam

The term "chiniya" in Hindi refers to a colloquial Hindi term used in some parts of India to mean "Chinese." Interestingly, the word is used to denote small versions of various items, like "chiniya kela" for small bananas. The etymology of "chiniya" traces back to "Chini," which means Chinese. It reflects how cultural interaction and trade have influenced language, embedding foreign references into local dialects. The reference to "chini" meaning 'Chinese' is also interesting because it doubles as the Hindi word for refined sugar, indicating historical trade routes and the introduction of sugar processing techniques from China.

"Badam" is the Hindi word for "almond," but in some Indian regions, particularly in Bihar, Jharkhand and Benhgal, "chiniya badam" is used to refer to peanuts. This usage highlights regional linguistic variations and how words evolve based on local customs and agricultural practices.

Fun fact: In the viral meme "kaccha badam", the badam actually refers to the "chiniya badam" which are peanuts, and not almonds.

---

## 19. Gandhraj and Raatrani

The name of the flower "Gandhraj" is derived from two Hindi words: "Gandh" meaning "fragrance" or "smell," and "Raj" meaning "king." It translates to "king of fragrance," and refers to the "Gardenia" or "Cape Jasmine" flower which goes by the latin name "Gardenia jasminoides."

Similarly, the name "Raatrani" is derived from the Hindi words "Raat" meaning "night," and "rani" meaning "queen." It translates to "queen of the night," and refers to the "Night-blooming jasmine" or "Cestrum nocturnum" flower.

Love how the two flowers are named after royalty, perhaps alluding to the fact that jasmine is considered a symbol of purity, love, and beauty, and is often used in romantic contexts.

---

## 20. Rickshaw

The word "rickshaw" originates from the Japanese word "jinrikisha," which breaks down into "jin" meaning "a man," "riki" meaning "power," and "sha" meaning "vehicle." This term was used to describe a small, two-wheeled cart for one passenger that is pulled by a person. The WWE wrestler "Rikishi"'s name is also derived from here.

---

## 21. Ghoti

The word "ghoti" is often cited in discussions about the irregularity of English spelling. It is a constructed example used to illustrate the complexities and inconsistencies of English orthography. The pronunciation /fɪʃ/ (like "fish") is derived by taking the "gh" from "enough" (/f/), the "o" from "women" (/ɪ/), and the "ti" from "nation" (/ʃ/). This humorous example is used to demonstrate that English spelling rules can be contradictory and that phonetic spelling can lead to unexpected pronunciations.

---

## 22. Samosa

The word "samosa" is derived from the Persian word "sanbosag," which was used to describe a triangular pastry filled with minced meat. The Persian term itself is believed to have roots in the Central Asian word "samsa," which described a pastry filled with meat. The dish traveled to India through trade routes and evolved into the vegetarian version filled with spiced potatoes that is popular today.

---


## 23. Aftab and Mahtab

The word आफ़ताब (Aftab) in Hindi means the sun, literally translating to 'sun's heat'. This word was borrowed into Hindustani languages from Persian, and tracing back its origins leads us to the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) word root *tep-, which also forms the modern Hindi word ताप (tap) meaning 'heat'. The term is associated with warmth and radiance, which are characteristics of the sun.

Conversely, the word महताब (Mahtab) means the moon, literally 'moonshine', and is derived from Persian. The initial मह- (meh) in Mahtab signifies the moon, which has been a significant natural object for timekeeping even before the advent of modern calendars. In various languages, such as Hindi, Old English, German, Persian, and French, the words for 'moon' and 'month' share a common Proto-Indo-European root *méh₁n̥ss, highlighting the moon's historical role in measuring time.

---

## 24. Mensuration and Menstruation

The words 'mensuration' and 'menstruation' share phonetic similarities but differ in meaning. The commonality in these terms is not coincidental. Both derive from linguistic roots related to measurement and time. 'Mensuration' refers to the act or process of measuring, which connects to the PIE root *meh₁- associated with the moon. The moon has historically been integral to timekeeping. 'Menstruation' relates to the monthly cycle of biological processes in females, again linked to the moon's cycles. This etymology underscores the moon's pivotal role in early human attempts to track time and periodicity.
