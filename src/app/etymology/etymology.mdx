_**sidenote**: many of these little trivia were posted as tweets on my old deleted account several moons ago. thanks to gpt and claude, i was able to retrieve them from that massive tweet archive (over 270k tokens even after cleaning up). i also used these ai tools for some initial formatting and cleaning up, hence the language might sound a little ai-esque right now. i'll manually reword them all later and add proper references._

## 1. Noida and Okhla

NOIDA is an abbreviation of "New Okhla Industrial Development Authority." Funnily, OKHLA stands for "Old Canal Housing and Land Authority," where the "C" was replaced with "K" probably to make it easier to pronounce. The upcoming "New Noida" hence expands to "New New Old Canal Housing and Land Authority Industrial Development Authority,"

## 2. Anaphora

The term "anaphora" is a rhetorical device that involves the repetition of a word or phrase at the beginning of successive clauses or sentences. It comes from Ancient Greek anaphorá (ἀναφορά) meaning "a carrying back", a conjugation of aná (ἀνά) meaning "up" + phérō (φέρω) meaning "I carry".

In a simple sense, anaphora is a rhetorical device in which multiple phrases or verses start with the same word or words. For example, when Julius Caesar says "I came, I saw, I conquered", he is using anaphora by repeating "I" at the beginning of each clause. When Winston Churchill gave a speech to the House of Commons and said "We shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air", he is using anaphora by repeating "we shall fight" at the beginning of each clause.

## 3. Serendipity

The word "serendipity" refers to the occurrence of events by chance in a happy or beneficial way. It was coined by Horace Walpole in 1754, inspired by a Persian fairy tale, "The Three Princes of Serendip." Serendip is an old name for Sri Lanka. In the tale, the princes were always making discoveries by accidents and sagacity, of things they were not in quest of, which perfectly encapsulates the meaning of the word today.

---

## 4. Argentum and its Sanskrit Roots

The Latin term 'argentum' is where the chemical symbol 'Ag' for silver originates. The word 'argentum' itself is derived from Proto-Indo-European *h₂erǵ-, which means 'shiny' or 'white'. The Sanskrit 'रजत' (rajata) similarly denotes silver and is rooted in the ancient Indo-European language family, sharing a similar etymological lineage with Latin.

The Hindi word 'चांदी' (chandi) is also mentioned, which refers to silver. The term 'चांदी' is derived from the Prakrit word 'चन्दि' (chandi), which in turn came from the Sanskrit 'चन्द्र' (chandra), meaning 'moon', reflecting the shiny, moon-like appearance of silver.

---

## 5. Bangaladumpa

The term 'bangaladumpa' is used in Telugu to refer to a potato. This word is fascinating because 'bangala' refers to Bengal, and 'dumpa' in Telugu means 'tuber'. Bangaladumpa reflects historical trade or cultural exchanges between regions, as the name suggests it is a tuber from Bengal.

Fun fact: Potatoes became a part of Indian diet because Mr. Vasco, a Portuguese explorer, discovered the sea route to India and brought potatoes with him. The Portuguese had potatoes because years ago the Spanish invaded potato farms in South America and brought them to Europe.

Another interesting term is "rataloo," used in some parts of India to refer to purple yam or sweet potato. The name is derived from "rakt-aloo" (blood-potato) due to its color.

---

## 6. Falsafa and Philosophia

The word "falsafa" is an Urdu term that is borrowed from the Greek word "philosophia," meaning philosophy. The borrowing process involves minor modifications to fit the phonetic and grammatical context of the Urdu language. This type of word borrowing, where the original word is adopted with slight changes, is common in many languages and is known as a loanword.

---

## 7. French -ette Words

The suffix "-ette" of French origin is often added to words to denote a smaller version of something. Some examples include:

- Cigar + ette -> cigarette (a small cigar)
- Cask + ette -> caskette (casket, a small container)
- Bra + (l) + ette -> bralette (a smaller, lighter version of a bra)

The term "brunette" is derived from the French word "brun," which means "brown." The suffix "-ette," often used to form feminine nouns, indicates a smaller or lesser version of something. Therefore, "brunette" refers to a small brown person, typically used in the context of describing females with brown hair.

'Brun' in old French means brown. It comes from the proto-germanic root 'brūnaz'
Brunet in old English / French is a brown haired man
Brunette in the same two languages (and also in modern English) is a brown haired woman

The word "omelette" has its origins in the Latin word "lamella," meaning "a thin plate," which also gives rise to the word "laminate." This evolved into "le lemelle" in French, then to "alemelle," "alemette," and finally "omelette."

The word "etiquette" traces its origin to the French court of Louis XIV at Versailles, where "étiquettes" (literally "little cards") were used to remind courtiers to keep off the grass and follow other rules. The term came to mean "the rules of polite and correct behavior." The Old French word "estequier" means "to stick/attach," which evolved into "estiquette" in Middle French, referring to a small note or ticket. This further influenced the modern French term "étiquettes," which signifies a label or ticket.

---

## 8. Prapanch

Prapanch actually comes from Sanskrit and is a word borrowed into many languages. It literally means "five elements" and is referred to mean the world/sansaar. Hinduism considers these five as the basis of all cosmic creation. The word has evolved over time and in some regions/languages, it has come to mean "dhokha" or "scam," which is an interesting semantic shift. The use of 'prapanch' by Tulsidas in his works to mean earthly/worldly pleasures adds to its layered meaning across different contexts.

---

## 9. Pronouncing French Words like Bhojpuri

Repertoire (रेपटवा), boudoir (बूद्ध्वा), memoire (मेमवा), and reservoire (रेसर्ववा) are French words borrowed into English that end with -oire or -oir. These words are very easy to pronounce like a true Frenchperson if you start to think of them like Bhodpuri words such as बबुआ, रमुा, बलमवा.

---

## 10. Mosquito and Makkhi

The word "mosquito" comes from Spanish. It stems from the root "mosca," which means a "fly" (makkhi). Adding an "-ito" to a Spanish word forms a diminutive (smaller version of something), so a mosquito is literally a small fly. The "-ito" is used for males, and the female version is "-ita." This etymology highlights how the word evolved to indicate a small fly, emphasizing its diminutive nature in the Spanish language.

The word "mosca" in Spanish, which means a "fly," is related to the Sanskrit word "maksa-," which gives the Sanskrit word for a fly, "makshika" (मक्खिका), leading to the Hindi "makkhi." This connection showcases the linguistic evolution and the shared roots between Spanish and Sanskrit, illustrating the fascinating interplay of languages across cultures and time.

---

## 11. Metric System Prefixes

The prefixes "mili," "centi," and "deci" originate from Latin. These prefixes are commonly used in the metric system to denote fractional units of measurement, such as millimeter (one-thousandth of a meter), centimeter (one-hundredth of a meter), and decimeter (one-tenth of a meter).

The prefixes "deca," "hecto," and "kilo" come from Greek. They are used in the metric system to indicate multiples of units, such as decameter (ten meters), hectometer (one hundred meters), and kilometer (one thousand meters).

In counting currencies, "kilo," representing a thousand (as in 100k), is derived from Greek, while other terms such as million, billion, and trillion come from Latin. "Million" comes from the Italian "milione," which further traces back to "mille" in Latin, meaning "thousand." The terms "billion" and "trillion" follow similar etymological patterns, originating from the Latin words "bi-" (two) and "tri-" (three), combined with "million."

---

## 12. Shampoo and Champee

The English word "shampoo" is borrowed from the Hindi word "champee" (चंपी), which means to press or massage. This borrowing reflects the cultural and commercial exchange between Britain and India during the colonial period, where such practices were introduced to English speakers.

---

## 13. Varanasi, Benaras, and Banaras

Varanasi, also known as Benaras or Banaras, is a city in India with a rich historical and cultural heritage. The name Varanasi is derived from the names of two rivers, Varuna and Assi. These rivers are significant in the city's geography and cultural context. During the Mughal and British periods, the variations Benaras and Banaras became popular. Despite other stories regarding the origin of these names, the explanation involving the rivers is often considered the simplest and is supported by Occam's Razor, suggesting that the simplest explanation is usually the correct one.

---

## 14. Ephemeral

'Ephemeral' comes from the Greek word 'ephēmeros', which can be broken into 'epi' + 'hemera'. 'Epi' means on/upon, and 'hemera' means a day. In Greek mythology, Hemera was personified as the daughter of Erebus (darkness) and Nyx (night), and the sister of Aether (bright upper sky). Therefore, 'ephemera' in the literal sense is something that lasts for a day. The meaning has developed over time to refer to things that last for a very short time, such as plants/insects, fevers, and in the modern sense, anything fleeting, momentary, passing, or transitory.

---

## 15. Calendar Months

The names of these months have Latin roots that reflect their original positions in the Roman calendar, which had only 10 months beginning in March. 'September' has 'sept' in it, which is Latin for 7, even though it is the 9th month now. 'October' comes from 'octo', meaning 8 (as in octopus). 'November' is derived from 'novem', meaning 9, and 'December' from 'dec', meaning 10 (as in decametre). January and February were added later and were not part of the original Roman calendar.

---

## 16. Vulgar

The word 'vulgar' originates from the Latin word 'vulgaris,' which means 'common people.' The notion of being 'vulgar' in historical contexts referred to someone being a commoner. Over time, due to snobbery against common people, the term began to be associated with something rude or offensive. The term is also related to 'Vulgar Latin,' a branch of Latin that was considered the spoken form used by everyday people, as opposed to the classical Latin used in formal writings and speeches.

---

## 17. Romance Languages

Romance languages are called so because they originated from Rome. The term does not relate to romantic or affectionate communication but pertains to their roots in the Roman Empire and Latin language.

---

## 18. Chiniya and Badam

The term "chiniya" is colloquial Hindi term used in some parts of India to denote smaller versions of various items. For example, "chiniya kela" is used to refer to the smaller variety of bananas. It is derived from a Dravidian word "cinnā" meaning small, young, or little.

Interestingly, even though "badam" is the commonly-used Hindi word for almond, some East Indian regions, use "chiniya badam" and sometimes simply "badam" to refer to peanuts.

Fun fact: In the viral "kacha badam" meme, the man was actually selling raw peanuts, and not raw almonds.

---

## 19. Gandhraj and Raatrani

The name of the flower "Gandhraj" is derived from two Hindi words: "Gandh" meaning "fragrance" or "smell," and "Raj" meaning "king." It translates to "king of fragrance," and refers to the "Gardenia" or "Cape Jasmine" flower which goes by the latin name "Gardenia jasminoides."

Similarly, the name "Raatrani" is derived from the Hindi words "Raat" meaning "night," and "rani" meaning "queen." It translates to "queen of the night," and refers to the "Night-blooming jasmine" or "Cestrum nocturnum" flower.

Love how the two flowers are named after royalty, perhaps alluding to the fact that jasmine is considered a symbol of purity, love, and beauty, and is often used in romantic contexts.

---

## 20. Rickshaw

The word "rickshaw" originates from the Japanese word "jinrikisha," which breaks down into "jin" meaning "a man," "riki" meaning "power," and "sha" meaning "vehicle." This term was used to describe a small, two-wheeled cart for one passenger that is pulled by a person. The WWE wrestler "Rikishi"'s name is also derived from here.

---

## 21. Ghoti

The word "ghoti" is often cited in discussions about the irregularity of English spelling. It is a constructed example used to illustrate the complexities and inconsistencies of English orthography. The pronunciation /fɪʃ/ (like "fish") is derived by taking the "gh" from "enough" (/f/), the "o" from "women" (/ɪ/), and the "ti" from "nation" (/ʃ/). This humorous example is used to demonstrate that English spelling rules can be contradictory and that phonetic spelling can lead to unexpected pronunciations.

---

## 22. Samosa

The word "samosa" is derived from the Persian word "sanbosag," which was used to describe a triangular pastry filled with minced meat. The Persian term itself is believed to have roots in the Central Asian word "samsa," which described a pastry filled with meat. The dish traveled to India through trade routes and evolved into the vegetarian version filled with spiced potatoes that is popular today.

---


## 23. Aftab and Mahtab

The word आफ़ताब (Aftab) in Hindi means the sun, literally translating to 'sun's heat'. This word was borrowed into Hindustani languages from Persian, and tracing back its origins leads us to a Proto-Indo-European (PIE) word root (*tep-), which also forms the modern Hindi word ताप (tap) meaning 'heat'. The term is associated with warmth and radiance, which are characteristics of the sun.

Conversely, the word महताब (Mahtab) means the moon, literally 'moonshine', and is derived from Persian. The initial मह- (meh) in Mahtab signifies the moon, which has been a significant natural object for timekeeping even before the advent of modern calendars. In various languages, such as Hindi, Old English, German, Persian, and French, the words for 'moon' and 'month' share a common Proto-Indo-European root *méh₁n̥ss, highlighting the moon's historical role in measuring time.

These words are poetically used in the song "Chaudahvin ka Chand" sung by Mohammed Rafi, which begins with:
चौदवीं का चाँद हो, या आफ़ताब हो?
जो भी हो तुम खुदा की कसम, लाजवाब हो

The lyrics compare the beloved to both the full moon (चौदवीं का चाँद) and the sun (आफ़ताब), praising their beauty as beyond comparison.

---

## 24. Mensuration and Menstruation

The words 'mensuration' and 'menstruation' share phonetic similarities but differ in meaning. The commonality in these terms is not coincidental. Both derive from linguistic roots related to measurement and time. 'Mensuration' refers to the act or process of measuring, which connects to the PIE root *meh₁- associated with the moon. The moon has historically been integral to timekeeping. 'Menstruation' relates to the monthly cycle of biological processes in females, again linked to the moon's cycles. This etymology underscores the moon's pivotal role in early human attempts to track time and periodicity.

---

## 25. Eros and Related Words

The word 'eros' comes from the ancient Greek word ἔρως (érōs), which means "physical love, sexual desire". In Greek mythology, Eros was the god of love and sex. Some earlier records consider him a primordial god, while later ones regard him as the son of Aphrodite (goddess of love, lust, beauty) and Ares (god of war).

The Roman counterpart of Eros is Cupid, who is the son of Venus and Mars.

Words derived from 'eros' include:
- 'Erotic': something which invokes eros
- 'Erogenous': relating to certain areas of the body that are sensitive to stimulation

The concept of 'platonic love' is related to Plato's philosophical text "The Symposium", where he referred to two types of love:
1. Vulgar eros (earthly eros): materialistic, carnal desire
2. Divine eros: love which transcends physical attraction and goes over to the love of supreme beauty

The term 'platonic' hence came to be associated with the second type of love, referring to a spiritualness and purity of the emotion.

Interestingly, the ancient Greek word ἔραμαι (éramai) meaning "to love", which is related to ἔρως, comes from a reconstructed PIE root *h₁rem-, meaning "to rest". This root is cognate with the Sanskrit word रमते (ramate), which can mean "to delight/to enjoy/to rest/to play".

We can see this in common usage in Gujarati with the derived word રમવું (ramvu) meaning "to play"

---

## 26. Fax, Similie, Verisimilitude and Related Words

The word 'facsimile' is composed of two parts: 'fac' (meaning "to make") and 'simile' (meaning "similar"). Thus, a facsimile is "to make similar" or create an exact copy. This word was shortened over time to 'fax'.

'Simile' itself comes from the Latin word 'similis', meaning "like, resembling, of the same kind". This root forms many words in English, including:
- Assimilate
- Simulation
- Dissimulate
- Semblance
- Simultaneous
- Similar

The word 'verisimilitude' combines 'verus' (meaning "truth" in Latin) and 'similis'. It means "the appearance of truth or reality".

The Latin root 'verus' is the source of many English words related to truth:
- Verify
- Veracity
- Verdict
- Very

'Veritas', the Latin word for truth, is often used in educational institution mottos and was famously used by J.K. Rowling in the Harry Potter series for the truth potion "Veritaserum".

---

## 27. Vernalagnia and Related Words

'Vernalagnia' is a term meaning "a romantic mood brought about by spring". It combines two elements:

1. 'Vernal': relating to spring, from the Latin 'vernalis' meaning "of the spring". This comes from the Latin 'ver' (spring), which can be traced back to the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) root *wesr-.

2. '-lagnia': from Greek, meaning "an exacerbated desire or lust".

The PIE root *wesr- is the source of words for spring in various languages:
- Sanskrit: वसन्त (vasanta)
- Hindi/Urdu: बहार (bahaar), from Persian بهار (bahār)

The suffix '-lagnia' is similar (and subtler) to '-philia' which implies a more intense desire. It's often contrasted with '-phobia' (meaning "an irrational fear").

'Vernalagnia' is sometimes referred to as "spring fever" and describes the increase in romantic and desires that often accompanies the arrival of spring.

---

## 28. Juggernaut

The English word 'juggernaut', meaning "an unstoppable force or object", comes directly from the Sanskrit word जगन्नाथ (jagannātha), which means "lord of the universe". This is a name given to Krishna, a Hindu deity. The term entered English language through the historical practice of the Ratha Yatra festival, where devotees would pull massive chariots carrying idols of deities through the streets, sometimes leading to accidents due to the difficulty in controlling such large vehicles.

---

## 29. Chancellor and French-origin Words

While 'chancellor' does come from French, it's not a good example of the 'ch' being pronounced as 'sh' in English. This is likely because the word entered English long ago and its pronunciation was anglicized over time.

Better examples of French-origin words where 'ch' is pronounced as 'sh' in English include:
- Chandelier
- Chauffeur
- Chateau

The pronunciation of borrowed words often depends on when they entered the language. Newer foreign words tend to retain their original pronunciation, while older borrowings are more likely to be adapted to fit English phonetic patterns.

An interesting example is 'Paris'. The French pronounce it as "paariii", while English speakers pronounce it as it's written. This illustrates how the pronunciation of place names can vary between languages.

---

## 30. Anushthaan

In Bengali, ceremonies are called অনুষ্ঠান (anushthaan). This word is commonly used during pujas and other religious or cultural events. It's an example of how Bengali retains many Sanskrit words in popular usage which are not so common in Hindi.

The word अनुष्ठान (anushthaan) in Sanskrit means "ceremony" or "performance". While in Hindi, other words like उत्सव (utsav), जश्न (jashn), or कार्यक्रम (karyakram) are more frequent to denote ceremonies.

---

## 31. Mummy

The word "mummy" for preserved bodies originates from the Persian/Arabic word mūmiya/mūm, meaning wax or asphalt. Contrary to what most people think, it doesn't have anything to do with the "mummy" used to endearingly call our mothers.

---

## 32. Stiletto

The word "stiletto" literally means "dagger" in Italian. This name was given to the shoe style due to the long, thin, knife-like appearance of its heel.

---

## 33. Chintz and Calico

The word "chintz" in English comes from the Hindi word छींट (cheent), which means "spotted", "variegated", "speckled", or "sprayed". This reflects the printed or painted designs typical of chintz fabrics.

Chintz prints are often done on a plain-woven textile called "calico". The term "calico" is named after Calicut (modern-day Kozhikode), a city in Kerala, India, from where this type of textile originated.

---

## 34. Bandana

The word "bandana" comes from the bandhani (बांधनी) fabric that the British exported from India. Bandhani is a type of tie-dye textile.

---

## 35. Kangaroo

There's a humorous story (likely apocryphal) about the origin of the word "kangaroo". According to this tale, when British explorers asked indigenous Australians what the animal was called, the response "kangaroo" actually meant "I don't understand" in the local language. However, this is not the true etymology of the word.

---

## 36. Sambhar

Contrary to popular belief, the South Indian dish sambhar may have Marathi origins. One story suggests it was invented by Sambhaji, son of Shivaji, when he was in Thanjavur (Tamil Nadu). The name could be a combination of "Sambha" (short for Sambhaji) and "ahar" (meaning food).

---

## 37. Lesbian and Greece

The word "lesbian" literally means "of Lesbos", just as "American" means "of America". Lesbos is a Greek island in the northeastern Aegean Sea.

Around 630-570 BC, a poet named Sappho lived on Lesbos. She was known for her prolific and often erotic poetry, which included themes of love between women. Due to the homoerotic nature of her works, the term "lesbian" came to be associated with female homosexuality in the late 1800s.

Interestingly, this modern usage has created some controversy for the island's inhabitants and products. For example, wine produced on Lesbos, which has been famous since the 7th century BC (even mentioned by Homer), can no longer be marketed as "Lesbian wine" without confusion.

---

## 38. Firdaus and Paradise

The Urdu word "firdaus" (meaning "paradise" or "heaven") and the English word "paradise" share a common origin. Both words were borrowed from the ancient Greek word "parádeisos". This etymology showcases how words can evolve differently in various languages while retaining similar meanings.

---

## 39. Zeitgeist and Poltergeist

"Zeitgeist" is a German word meaning "the defining spirit or mood of a particular period of history as shown by the ideas and beliefs of the time". It's composed of "Zeit" (time/era/period) and "Geist" (spirit), literally meaning "time-spirit".

"Poltergeist" comes from German "poltern" (to rumble) and "Geist" (spirit/ghost). It refers to a noisy, mischievous ghost or spirit.

Both words use the German "Geist", which is related to the English "ghost" and comes from the Old High German "gaist".

---

## 40. Orange

The word "orange" has an interesting etymological journey. It originates from a Dravidian (South Indian) root "naram", which then entered Sanskrit to become "narangi". From there, it traveled through Persian, Arabic, and various European languages before becoming the English word "orange" we use today.

---

## 41. Gerika

The word "gerika" refers to a reddish soil found in India. Its distinct color comes from the presence of Iron Oxide. The term is inherited from the Sanskrit word for hematite, an ore of iron. Gerika was often used in Ayurvedic medicine and alchemy.

The Rasaprakāshasudhākara, a classical work on Medical Alchemy (rasaśāstra) by Yashodhara in the 13th century A.D., mentions गेरिक (gerika) as one of the uparasa ('secondary minerals'), a group of eight alchemical mineral agents.

_p.s.: dhruv from [logophilia](https://www.logophilia.in/) was the one who taught me to look at the world through these wonderful lenses of etymology and ever since then, nothing looked the same. thank you dhruv (not sponsored, just an appreciation from a grateful student)._
