for most of my time i write software.
i also write other stuff that i should share.
so i'm putting this site out there somewhere.
to give myself a teeny-tiny dare.
and write a little more, raw and bare.
maybe i'll do that a justice square and fair.
or maybe not â€” i honestly don't care.
all i want is to look up at the stars and stare.
and be a little more self-aware.
this rhyme makes no sense and it is so unfair;
to you dear reader for having to bear...
this nonsense that for a minute now you've stared.
i wish you had better things to care.
now while you're at it, check out my site here :)`}
