- [nibbles](#nibbles) - weekly tech newsletter

## nibbles

[nibbles](https://nibbles.dev/) is a tech newsletter that [aashutosh](https://aashutosh.dev/) and i write together. we started it in april 2023 and since then, we have shipped every single week without breaks. other than being an excuse to write in public, it is a way for us to remain updated with what's the going on in tech and keep a journal for us to refer back to.
