- [nibbles](#nibbles) - weekly tech newsletter

## nibbles

[Nibbles](https://nibbles.dev/) is a weekly tech newsletter by [aashutosh](https://aashutosh.dev/) and me covering the latest developments in AI, Crypto, Dev & Design and some fun tools and recommendations. We started it in April 2023 and since then, we try to make sure it reaches your inbox every week. Other than being an excuse to write in public, it is a way for us to remain updated with what's the going on in tech and keep a journal for us to refer back to. Currently it has over 300 subscribers and over 2k monthly views.
