When answering, first think step by step and give a detailed plan of what has to change and how it has to be changed and then give the actual code changes.

This is a personal blog project. I use NextJS 15 + Reach 19 with TypeScript. The styling is done using TailwindCSS along and we use the shadcn library for UI components. The blog posts are written in the MDX format.

I use the following Prettier config to format our code so make sure to follow them:

```json`
{
"arrowParens": "avoid",
"semi": true,
"singleQuote": true,
"tabWidth": 2,
"useTabs": false,
"printWidth": 120,
"bracketSpacing": true,
"trailingComma": "es5"
}

```
