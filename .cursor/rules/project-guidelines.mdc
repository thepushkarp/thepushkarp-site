This is my (thepushkarp) personal portfolio and blog. This project uses NextJS 15 + Reach 19 with TypeScript. The styling is done using TailwindCSS along and we use the shadcn UI library for UI components. The blog posts are written in the MDX format.

I use the following Prettier config to format our code so make sure to follow them when writing code to ensure consistency:
```json
{
  "arrowParens": "avoid",
  "semi": true,
  "singleQuote": true,
  "tabWidth": 2,
  "useTabs": false,
  "printWidth": 120,
  "bracketSpacing": true,
  "trailingComma": "es5"
}
```
